My Personal Review:

Add a little hot water, and viola, a man! Add a little cold water… and suddenly he’s… a girl! A cross-dresser’s dream come true.

Ranma is an unfortunate man who accidently fell into an accursed pond while training with his father, Genma, in China. This certain pond happened to be the pond of “drowned girl”, meaning, whenever Ranma is splashed with cold water he turns into a girl! When he’s splashed with hot water however, he turns back into a man. His father on the other hand, fell into the pond of “drown panda”, you can pretty much guess what happens to him, right? Anyways, Genma made a promise with his old friend, Soun Tendo, to pretty much marry off Ranma to one of his three children; Kasumi (the oldest graceful and most cheerful of the three), Nabiki (the 2nd oldest of the three, a not-so-cheerful and conniving business woman), and Akane (the youngest of the three, who dislikes men and is very good with martial arts). Ranma is to marry one of the three sisters to carry on his father’s dojo, the “Anything Goes Martial Arts” dojo. The sisters quickly nominate Akane, since she is around Ranma’s age, and dislikes men. (since Ranma is only half man, and half woman!) At first Akane can’t stand Ranma after she walked in on him, as a girl, in the bathroom, when he suddenly turned into a man, and she threw a table at him calling him a pervert. But, after time, they start to develop a bond together. Together with Shampoo (A head-strong Amazoness Chinese woman who rivals Akane for Ranma’s love since he defeated her in a contest and she gave him the “kiss of death” in his girl form, and falls in love with his man form, who turns into a cat), Cologne (Shampoo’s Great-Grandmother and the head of the Amazon tribe of China, who supports Shampoo in trying to gain Ranma’s love), Mousse (a Chinese man, and long friend of Shampoo who is also obsessed with her, without his glasses he is extremely blind and mistakes things for other things quite often, he also turns into a duck), Tatewaki Kuno (an upperclassman at Akane’s school, and leader of the Kendo club with a big ego and big crush on Akane, he becomes Ranma’s rival for her love, he also fell for Ranma’s girl form calling her the “goddess in pig-tails), Kodachi Kuno (Tatewaki’s sister who is very good with Martial Arts Gymnastics who attends an all-girl school, she is defeated by male Ranma and believes that female Ranma is after male Ranma and becomes a rival against male Ranma, who is the same person… she uses paralysis gasses and poisonouse roses to try and win male Ranma, against female Ranma), Ukyo Kuonji (a childhood friend of Ranma, whom Ranma never realized was a girl, her father runs an Okonomiyaki restaurant, and the Okonomiyaki-style Martial Arts, who “less violently” tries to win Ranma’s love), Hikaru Gosunkugi (a nerdy “voodoo” guy from Akane’s school who is in love with her as well, who uses voodoo tricks on Ranma quite often, he also enjoys taken forbidden pictures of Akane to sell to Kuno), Dr. Tofu Ono (A very kind chiropractor who secretly loves Kasumi but Akane secretly loves him since he often took care of her wounds as a child, however when Kasumi is around he becomes a fool who can’t concentrate and ends up hurting his patients (Ranma in general haha)), Ryoga Hibiki (a man who has a horrible sense of direction, and a childhood rival of Ranma, he was pushed into a cursed “piglet” spring by Ranma so he changes into a cute piglet formerly known (by Akane) as P-chan. He also becomes a love rival with Ranma for Akane, he’s very shy and kind around women, especially Akane but is easily angered by Ranma), Happosai (A very perverted old man, Ranma’s founder of the “Anything Goes Martial Arts” dojo, he was believed to be gone, but returns and becomes an obsessive “panty thief”, but at the same time a very skilled martial artist), together they all continue their journey together in this comedic war-field of rivalry.

Ranma 1/2 is truly a comical and fun classic anime of 7 seasons, one of my instant favorites of all time. I would say it could be for any age to watch, but at the same time might be offensive to some viewers.  I’d definitely recommend watching this one though, an instant classic!
